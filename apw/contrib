Licensing

All code contributed to the project falls under the FFS license, unless otherwise specified. We will accept 
third-party code which falls under MIT, BSD or completely permissivie licences, but copyleft licensing 
(eg GPL, and AGPL) is not permitted. 

Coding Style

In the interests of consistency we adopt the following code styling. We may accept patches using other styles, 
but where possible please try to provide a consistent code style. We aren't going to argue or debate the merits 
of this style, and it is irrelevant what project 'xyz' uses. This is not project 'xyz'. This is a baseline 
to try and keep the code readable now and in the future.

All comments should be in English.

Indentation is accomplished primarily with tabs using a tab-width of 4.

String concatenation and operators should be separated by whitespace. e.g. "$foo = $bar . 'abc';" instead of 
"$foo=$bar.'abc';"

Generally speaking, we use single quotes for string variables and double quotes for SQL statements. "Here 
documents" should be avoided. Sometimes using double quoted strings with variable replacement is the most efficient 
means of creating the string. In most cases, you should be using single quotes.

Use whitespace liberally to enhance readability. When creating arrays with many elements, we will often set one 
key/value pair per line, indented from the parent line appropriately. Lining up the assignment operators takes a bit 
more work, but also increases readability.

Generally speaking, opening braces go on the same line as the thing which opens the brace. They are the last character 
on the line. Closing braces are on a line by themselves.
