This is a new subtheme to redbasic. I intend it to be a basis for some experimentation, yet I hope to offer some useful ideas while learning to hack the matrix myself. :)

Even though I am using this at my own installations (or because of it?) I do know that there is a whole lot of room for improvement. I see myself more as a usability guy than graphic designer, therefore I am always open for suggestions and improvements.
